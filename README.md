grokking_tests.ipynb has demonstrations of different modules and some basic experiments on loading models and creating hooked versions of them.\n
data_modadd.py can be used for generating modular addition dataset where length of the list of numbers to be summed and the base with which you take the modulo can be set in the main function. \n
Please change the data path in the data_modadd.py and in the grokking_tests.ipynb jupyter notebook to 'data/<file>.pt', also create a data folder. \n
train_modadd.py is for model training.
